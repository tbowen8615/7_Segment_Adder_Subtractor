# 7_Segment_Adder_Subtractor
This is a Verilog file that describes a 7 segment adder subtractor.  
In Visual Studio Code, install the following extensions:  
1) Verilog Testbench Runner  
2) Verilog-HDL/SystemVerilog/Bluespec SystemVerilog  
3) WaveTrace
After Installing these three extensions, you can run the verilog file provided. A waveform will be generated in a .vcd file. When thhis file is opened, you can click "add signals." Add the signals in the order provided in the image. This is what you can use to understand tbe behavior of the hardware being described. I have also provided top level diagrams for a high level intuitive understanding of the modules and their connections.
